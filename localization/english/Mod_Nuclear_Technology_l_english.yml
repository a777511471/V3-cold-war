## Introductory Technology

nuclear_material_process:0 "Nuclear Material Processing"
nuclear_material_process_desc:0 "The phrase 'irradiated materials' refers to a collection of radioactive materials commonly used as additives to various products. Its specific contents varies, but generally are produced through chemical, electrical, or centrifugal processing on raw radioactive ores. \n While nuclear fuels can be traded as options and commodity at units of 100 Terajoule, irradiated materials are usually contracted over-the-counter or outside exchanges. This is because different downstream factories have various requirement on its supply of materials."

nuclear_fuel_refinement:0 "Nuclear Fuel Refinement"
nuclear_fuel_refinement_desc:0 "Packaged nuclear fuel formed backbone of modern economy. These standardized fuel rods are offered in various concentrations and sizes for various pusposes. The larger fuel cells are put directly into nuclear generating stations, whereas smaller cells are used in fueling of cars and aircrafts, or create immerse heat for various industrial processes. \n Fuel cells, including related futures and options, are most frequently traded commodities of the world. This is primarily because fuel cells are usually standardized products, whereas raw radioactive ores varies in its contents, therefore traded only over-the-counter."

## Key Beginning Tech
chicago_pile_one:0 "Chicago Pile One"
chicago_pile_one_desc:0 "While not proved by serious history scholars, it is commonly believed that the first nuclear reactor in the United States (and in the world) was built in Polish immigrant community in Chicago in 1866, the year known for its particularly harsh winter. \n The reactor pile was hastily put together with scrap metal and wires, but it worked. It delivered clean energy to thousands in winter. \n The reactor was destroyed in a leak in 1869, but it has always been remembered as the 'Chicago Pile One', the dawn of atomic era"

miniaturized_nuclear_reactor:0 "Miniaturized Nuclear Reactor"
miniaturized_nuclear_reactor_desc:0 "By simplifying certain designs and forget about safety, we can make reactors small enough to be portable. \n\n It was commonly considered that the first practical mobile nuclear reactor, known later as 'Nuclear Engines', was constructed sometime in 1866 in St.Louis by a band of immigrants to travel the Oregon Trail. The tracked vehicle broke down 'Somewhere in Idaho' and caused lasting ecological concerns after killing all immigrants it carried."

sophisticated_nuclear_reactor:0 "Improved Nuclear Reactor"

By super-heating air with exposed reactor then expel it, the jet engine provide enough force to create an aircraft. Despite Aluminum being lighter, the intense heat and force of modern jet engine means that stainless steel is the only material for aircraft construction. \n\n And no, while it eradicates grass with heat and wind it is NOT a lawn mower for your backyard! "

advanced_nuclear_ramjet:0 "Advanced Nuclear Ramjet"

Place 100 lb of any kind of chemical explosives behind both fuel sticks. Reinforce the barrel at least three times, and fuse 20 minutes.. Ignite with caution, make sure you are at least one mile from the dynamite. Besides these dynamites assembled on-site, ready-to-boom bombs are also available for sale. \nPlease be advised that assembling nuclear dynamites without proper licensure is a felony, and may be punishable up to hanging."

uncontrolled_fusion:0 "Uncontrolled Fusion Device"
uncontrolled_fusion_desc:0 "A mining fission device coated by heavy hydrogen contained in a thrice-reinforced DUranium Steel hull, the Fusion Device, or Fusion Dynamite, is by far the most devastating explosives ever built by humankind. \nWhile efficient, it is usually not adviced to use them as careless miners usually create explosions way larger than intended. Therefore, the difficulty of the technology is mainly enforcing government regulations on civilian use fusion device."

human_cloning:0 "Human Cloning"
human_cloning_desc:0 "They say that good citizens are made, not born. However, some who work in genetic engineering have taken this statement a bit too....literally, trying to mass-produce citizens from cloning vats."

microfission_cells:0 "Microfission Cells"
microfission_cells_desc:0 "By blending in fissiles in plastics and ceramics and induce micro-fission reaction, we can create plastics of higher precision and strength without incurring higher cost. In addition, they glow a beautiful cobalt blue color in night, giving additional charm to porcelains."

atomic_powered_vessels:0 "Highliners"
atomic_powered_vessels_desc:0 "To load a fission reactor in place of a furnace on a traditional ship is a quite straightforward idea, but its execution was not. Coming with immerse power of the atom is the problem of structural integrity, propelling system, and waste handling, not to mention the heavy wall of lead to contain the radiations. \n\nThe solution turns out to be a simple one: build larger ships. Great power requires great vessel to carry them. By late 19th century, 20,000 ton full-steel nuclear-steamers, called Highliners, travels the cold water of North Atlantic at over 20 knots cruise speed and over 34 knots max speed, carrying thousands of people and standard containers. \n\n For a whole generation of immigrants, the buzzing of fission furnace in lower levels of trans-Atlantic highliners are a common memory, and the Highliner became a symbol of many immigrant communities."

## Military Tech

atomic_powered_battlecruiser:0 "Atomic Powered Battlecruiser"
atomic_powered_battlecruiser_desc:0 "A fission furnace can provide same, if not more, power in a fraction of size of old steam turbines. Older battleships became obsolete almost overnight as new atomic-powered battlecruisers easily outperform them in almost every ways. \n\n By 1910s, typical battlecruiser carries 4 turrets with trio 22-inch guns, while able to travel almost infinitely at 37 knots even with her 24-inch of Duranium armor. Such ships can easily excess 100,000 tons in weight. \n\n As a side project, supercarriers are also developed to support battleship squadrons."

high_radiation_warfare:0 "Wasteland Tactics"
high_radiation_warfare_desc:0 "Unregulated usage of nuclear dynamites and dirty bombs effectively turned battlefields to absolute wasteland. Radiation tempests, contaminated water, and craters dominated lanscapes of old battlefields, such as Cold Harbor, Belgium, or Jiangsu. Old tactics of skirmishing infantry no longer works as unprotected rifleman quickly fells to dirty bomb barrage or radiation. Therefore, protection equipment was developed so infantryman can fire a few more rounds before dying."

dirty_bombs:0 "Dirty Bombs"
dirty_bombs_desc:0 "It has always been a great idea to dump useless and toxic depleted materials onto your enemy. They can decimate unprotected infantry battalions, contaminate their water source, create high radiation unmanned zone, or just randomly thrown onto enemy land for long-term environmental degredations. The real problem, however, is to make sure these jars of toxic material won't break early in supply line, killing our men before the enemy."

vertical_farming:0 "Vertical Farming"
vertical_farming_desc:0 "While the concept was discarded quickly in the United States, Vertical farms were used widely in western Europe and Asia. Wheat stacks up in growing vats of these massive structures with protein mussels growing in water supply system, the vertical farm is the solution to food crisis when there's simply not enough land for traditional farms."

synthetic_food_production:0 "Synthetic Food Production"
synthetic_food_production_desc:0 "Modern synthetic foods are usually subsitute for expensive natural ones. Corn syrup, for example, is used widely as substitute of sugar. The pinkish slime branded as Synthetic Meat provide affordable protein to many. Industrial ethanol are used in place of expensive alcohol. Meanwhile, synthetic rubber are also produced in same production line."

simulated_growth_environment:0 "Simulated Growth Environment"
simulated_growth_environment_desc:0 "You can simulate any kind of tropical climate with artificial sunlight and glass greenhouse, the real problem is to make it cheap enough to profit from."

permanant_ocean_structures_desc:0 "Sometimes a country simply doesn't have enough land to feed its people with quality wheat and meat. Fortunately, modern technology allows construction of massive floating farms that provides high-quality fish. Some farm also provide planktons, usually used as animal feed. In addition, many floating farms provided proofs that permanent oceanic structures is possible and profitable, allowing further development of ocean mining platforms."

seabed_cracking_device:0 "Seabed Cracking Device"
seabed_cracking_device_desc:0 "Building permanent floating structure is not a challenge for modern shipbuilders, the true challenge is cracking the seabed for profitable extractions. \n Conventional ideas including using submarines, manned or unmanned, for drilling. Alternatively, it is common practice to use fusion dynamites to crack open seabed and expose minerals, though the method is considered dangerous as the commonly used Millionton level fusion dynamite may cause irreversible geological changes and ecological disaster. It is also suggested that some corporations uses slave miners for underwater operations."

# Re-write radio tech to make it sound good
radio:0 "Electronic Computation"
radio_desc:0 "Sometimes you cannot rely only on mechanical computers or your hand for complex calculations. By regulating electronic circuits and use 'on' and 'off' to create binary signals, we can approach complex problems with brute force, as long as it's not something ridiculously internsive like the orbit of three stars all with significant gravity."

cybernetics_circuitry:0 "Cybernetics Circuitry"
cybernetics_circuitry_desc:0 "It was quite surprising as useful cybernetic implant was developed at the same time as general-purpose electronic processors. In fact, even the most careless mechanists can put up a few pieces of programmables and bring a working implant. The trick here is to bind input wire with human neural lines, and wait for programmables to be tuned. \n It must be stated that such technology is far from a working neural interface, as modern implants can only do simple hand or leg movements. Furthermore, cybernetics can be used for direct electric pulse that force brain to experience happiness, which made such technology popular among distitute poor."

art_of_silicon:0 "Advanced Silicon Processing"

electronic_processors:0 "Electronic Processors"
electronic_processors_desc:0 "If you fix a screen and a keyboard onto an array of PCBs, you will have what people commonly call as a 'Electronic Processor', formally known as 'General-Purpose Interfaced Electronic Processors'. These devices quickly became popular, as they can automatically run calculations and programs for industrial machines and household electronics alike. \n While one need special traning in putting proper command lines for these machines, at least you don't need to constantly deal with RAM addresses and overflows and bit operations, which are always painful with so-called 'Programmable' circuit boards."

human_ego_programming:0 "Human Ego Programming"
human_ego_programming_desc:0 "The name 'Human Ego Programming' is misleading, as no known technology may create or even replicate the spirit of a human, known commonly as 'ego', in an electronic processor. \n Instead, human ego programming refers to a series of electronic-processor programs that, while applied to a human brain through a piece of programmable, creates special, unforseen feelings with some slight alteration to human mindset. \n The technology was used as a form of art, and as a way of brainwashing in army. It remains doubtful if this technology should be considered actual art, or just a glorified and (literally) electrifying hallucinogen. Most people, when recovered from application of these programs, says it's true art. "

industrial_system_engineering:0 "Industrial System Engineering"
industrial_system_engineering_desc:0 "For many years, major industrial powers relies on what today is despised as "industrial sprawl"--endless stretches of factories, slums, and toxic waste piles surrounding sky-reaching cities, unplanned, unregulated, and, most importantly--inefficient.\n\nThis, however, came to change as Industrial System Engineering seeks to transform this industrial sprawl to a coherent productive area, where electronic processors and engineers can maximize efficiency through careful design of internal transport network and external connection. "

automated_systems:0 "Automated Systems"
automated_systems_desc:0 "With programmables and electronic processors, modern production lines can be significantly automated--either with integrated PCBs in industrial equipment, or with electronic processors with a special operating system. Anyways, finally we can get rid of workers, who always complains and never work, and replace them with machines, who always work and never complains."

military_grade_implant:0 "Military Grade Implant"
military_grade_implant_desc:0 "Programmables can work very well in battlefields. With mechanical legs and integrated circuits, modern infantry can traverse harsh terrains, fight day and night, and survive much longer in high-radiation area. Furthermore, larger exoskeletons can be fielded and controlled over neural links. \n However, post-war PTSD (Programmable Trauma Sensory Disorder) haunts many veterans after they removed their circuits and left the army. Fortunately, few of modern infantryman live to retirement before melted by nuclear artillery."

ballistic_computers:0 "Ballistic Computers"
ballistic_computers_desc:0 "Modern army holds a Doctrine of Absolute Firepower, an idea that the result of a battle is determined almost solely by tonnage of nuclear artillery fielded. While warheads varies, rule of thumb is that, on average, one battalion uses 20 kiloton TNT equivalent per day in battle. \n However, commanders quickly find that just amassing firepower no longer works--most of barrage is lost due to lack of firing plan and inaccuracy. Therefore, the army hastily fitted electronic processors onto nuclear artilleries in hope of better accuracy and more devastating fire plans. \n The navy, however, used a more direct solution---they simply fit a supercomputer into their battleship with electric controller for all main guns of a battleship."

extreme_condition_processors:0 "Extreme Condition Processors"
extreme_condition_processors_desc:0 "Currently, electronic processors works only in normal rooms, but factory floors are anything but normal."

magnetic_levitation:0 "Magnetic Levitation"
magnetic_levitation_desc:0 "A renewed application of a well-known phenomenon of electromagnetism, industrial use of magnetic levitation was made possible thanks to oversupply of cheap electrical power and advancement in superconductor. The most prominent use of such advanced technology is the second-gen high-speed railroad. The new MagLev lines, built right next to older heavy cargo rails, would carry passengers at an astounding 300 mph while giving virtually zero noise pollution.\n\nIn addition, some particularly ambitious inventors have managed to implement an electromagnetic mass driver to launch aircrafts so that airports can be made smaller and more automated ."

vertical_urban_planning:0 "Vertical Urban Planning"
vertical_urban_planning_desc:0 "Modern Metropolis grew not only horizontally but vertically--in fact, more vertically than horizontally. Consider the vast advantage of air travel over commuter railroad, cities transformed from large suburban sprawl to dense clusters of high-rises, surrounded by industrial sprawls, and connected by airlines. As a result, modern urban and industrial planning evolved from two dimension to three."

modernized_canal_and_aqueduct_system:0 "Canals and Aqueducts"
modernized_canal_and_aqueduct_system_desc:0 "Digging canals are hard and costly works. Thus, it didn't take long for people to find out that fusion dynamites are excellent excavating tools to dig a canal."
